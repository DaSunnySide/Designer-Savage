# Final Project For Intermediate C#
#Joseph Schmidt

This repository is a list of files I worked on to practice C# and Java. Most of the Java problems are coding questions from "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell. I tried to include problems with a variety of topics, such as linked lists, graphs, stacks, queues, and more!

Although this only includes 25 files, some of the files are rather large, so I hope that it will still suffice!!
